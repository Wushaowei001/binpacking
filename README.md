Binpacking-related Problems
===========================

This repository contains experimental source code for solving different binpacking problems
(binpacking, multidimensional binpacking, multiknapsack, generalized assigment problems, ...).

So far, there has been a single release of code (in the subdirectory `/release`) for a simple
decomposition of the multidimensional binpacking constraint in a Constraintr Programming solver.
We wrote a small report about the approach, which will be added to this repository once we will
get a peer review.
